# Particle Simulation
The project implements three different methods of a gravitational n-body particle simulation .  
The solvers are implemented in C language where one version is serial and the other two are parallel versions, using OpenMP and MPI.

## Usage

All the commands should be executed on the root directory of the project.  
### Serial Implementation

The **-lm** flag is required when compiling the parallel code to link the math library.  

#### Compile the source code
* Serial
    * `gcc -fopenmp -o simpar simpar.c`

* Parallel
    * `gcc -fopenmp -o simpar-omp simpar-omp.c`

#### Execute the source code
All the commands can receive the following arguments:  
`seed` **required** Seed for the random number generator  
`ncside` **required** Size of the grid (number of cells on the side)  
`npart` **required** Number of particles  
`nstep` **required** number of time-steps  

* **On Windows**
    * `.\simpar.exe [seed] [ncside] [npart] [n_step]`  
    * Example: `.\simpar.exe 1 3 10 1`
	
* **On Linux/macOS:**  
    * `./simpar [seed] [ncside] [npart] [n_step]`  
    * Example: `./simpar 1 3 10 1`


#### How to change the number on the parallel version
Use the command line / terminal / powershell to perform the modification.  

Examples showing how to change the number of threads to 2.

**On the command line**  
`set OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`
	
**On the power shell**  
`$env:OMP_NUM_THREADS = 2`

**On the linux terminal**  
`export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`


#### Input/Ouput format
All the implementations follow the same input and output format.
	
**Output**  
The program output consists of two lines where the first line is the final position of particle #0 and the second line is center of mass of the overall space at the end of simulation. 

Output File Example: 
```
0.87 0.42
0.55 0.59
```
